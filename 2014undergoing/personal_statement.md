#Personal statement of Zhang Qiaoyuan

Being from China and never been abroad, I have always wanted to explore the territories that are uncharted for me.

California, the state that has been pushing the boundaries of legislation and leading in various social innovations became my first choice.

#### Why would I be a suitable candidate for Haas

* Relentless execution.

	I often find myself achieving goals that I put my heart and soul to.
	I onece went 48 hours without any sleep to finished a project that I was engaged to.

* Stepping out of the boundary.
	
	Settling in is not a part of my nature. I was the first one amongst my fellow classmates to present my ideas in Reveal.js rather than PowerPoint. (Reveal.js is an online presentation tool written in JavaScript, which requires a certain amount of tech savviness to master.)
	
	I was also the first one to use Zhihu(similar to Quora) and left weibo(similar to twitter). I enjoyed informed ideas more than fragmented pieces of information that are out of context.

* Persistence.
	
	I used to be the anchor of the school radio station. In seven month, I gatherd materials, edited the recorded tapes and made the broadcast, without ever missing a deadline.
	
* Problem solving oriented.

	Problems excite me. I see them as an opportunity to explore unknown areas. I usually take the approach of breaking problems down into smaller subsets of problems, deducing unknown from known, and then conquer each one.
	
* Personal time management.

	This is my personal key to high velocity of work and productivity. I manage my time precisely, one small problem for a short period of time. This allows me to look back and review my conduct more frequently and avoid any pitfalls.
	
	I believe it's the accumulation of this effect makes my work meet my own satisfaction.

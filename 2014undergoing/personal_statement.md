#Personal statement of Zhang Qiaoyuan

Being from China and never been abroad, I have always wanted to explore the territories that are uncharted for me.

California, the state that has been pushing the boundaries of legislation and leading in various social innovations became my first choice.

During the four years at WHUT, I was the first one amongst my fellow classmates to present my ideas in Prezi and Reveal.js rather than PowerPoint. (Reveal.js is an online presentation tool written in JavaScript, which requires a certain amount of tech savviness to master.) I was also the first one to use Zhihu(similar to Quora) and left weibo(similar to twitter). I enjoyed informed ideas more than fragmented pieces of information that are out of context. I believe one conclusion we can draw from this is that settling for the status quo is not a part of my nature.

Aside from getting myself acquainted with new ideas, I often find myself achieving goals that I put my heart and soul to. I once went 48 hours without any sleep to finished a project that I was engaged to. I used to be the anchor of the school radio station. In seven month, I gatherd materials, edited the recorded tapes and made the broadcast, without ever missing a deadline.

Campus life could be both enjoyable and stressful, for that there are always new problems to solve, from courses we take and from day to day life. One of the stressful things was that my achievement in college is nothing to be proud of at the begining. But if we look over the years, my GPA went from 2.7 to 2.9, to 3.1 and finally to 3.5. We can clearly draw a line that increases stably over the axis of my college life.

The reason that I was able to pull myself up in terms of GPA is that rather than getting intimidated by problems, I see them as an opportunity to strengthen myself. I usually take the approach of breaking problems down into smaller subsets of problems, deducing unknown from known, and then conquering each one, resolving  challenges with fulfilment.

Another element that help me to achieve a high velocity of work and productivity during the tiring nights of study is time management. I manage my time precisely, one small problem for a short period of time. This allows me to look back and review my conduct more frequently and avoid any pitfalls. I believe it's the accumulation of this effect makes my work meet my own satisfaction.

Given the modest place that I started with, rocketing through the roof might be setting the bar too high, but the achievement in the past gives me the confidence to assert that a stably increasing curve would be kept during the future years of fulfilling life at Haas.

#Personal statement of Zhang Qiaoyuan

Being from China and never been abroad, I have always wanted to explore the territories that are uncharted for me.

California, the state that has been pushing the boundaries of legislation and leading in various social innovations became my first choice.

During the four years at WHUT, I was the first one amongst my fellow classmates to present my ideas in Reveal.js rather than PowerPoint. (Reveal.js is an online presentation tool written in JavaScript, which requires a certain amount of tech savviness to master.) I was also the first one to use Zhihu(similar to Quora) and left weibo(similar to twitter). I enjoyed informed ideas more than fragmented pieces of information that are out of context. I believe one conclusion we can draw from this is that settling for the status quo is not a part of my nature.

Aside from getting myself acquainted with new ideas, I often find myself achieving goals that I put my heart and soul to. I once went 48 hours without any sleep to finished a project that I was engaged to. I used to be the anchor of the school radio station. In seven month, I gatherd materials, edited the recorded tapes and made the broadcast, without ever missing a deadline.

Campus life could be both enjoyable and stressful, for that there are always new problems to solve, from courses we take and from day to day life. Rather than getting intimidated, I see them as an opportunity to strengthen myself. I usually take the approach of breaking problems down into smaller subsets of problems, deducing unknown from known, and then conquer each one, resolving  challenges with fulfilment.

One of the keys of my high velocity of work and productivity is time management. I manage my time precisely, one small problem for a short period of time. This allows me to look back and review my conduct more frequently and avoid any pitfalls. I believe it's the accumulation of this effect makes my work meet my own satisfaction.
